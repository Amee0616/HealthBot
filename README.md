##  :beginner: About
Welcome to our Patient Education Chatbot, a cutting-edge tool designed to make high-quality patient education more accessible and improve health outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.

In the ever-evolving healthcare industry, patient-centric care is paramount. Effective patient engagement is essential, and central to this is patient education. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), patient education involves "influencing patient behavior and producing the changes in knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to maintain or improve health."

Our chatbot is dedicated to empowering patients with the knowledge they need to manage their health effectively. 
Our goal is to transform patient education, making it more interactive, accessible, and effective. By using our Patient Education Chatbot, healthcare providers can foster better patient engagement, empower patients to take control of their health, and ultimately achieve better clinical outcomes. 

## :zap: Usage
Using our HealthBot App is straightforward and user-friendly. Simply install it from the App Store or Android Store or download on your device and begin addressing your questions and concerns immediately.

 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to `stage` branch.
2. Comply with the best practices and guidelines e.g. where the PR concerns visual elements it should have an image showing the effect.
3. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.

After this, changes will be merged.
