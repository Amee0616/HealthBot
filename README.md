##  :beginner: About
Welcome to our Patient Education Chatbot, a cutting-edge tool designed to make high-quality patient education more accessible and improve health outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.

In the ever-evolving healthcare industry, patient-centric care is paramount. Effective patient engagement is essential, and central to this is patient education. According to the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), patient education involves "influencing patient behavior and producing the changes in knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to maintain or improve health."

Our chatbot is dedicated to empowering patients with the knowledge they need to manage their health effectively. 
Our goal is to transform patient education, making it more interactive, accessible, and effective. By using our Patient Education Chatbot, healthcare providers can foster better patient engagement, empower patients to take control of their health, and ultimately achieve better clinical outcomes.
